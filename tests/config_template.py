!!! RENAME THIS FILE TO config.py !!!

Replace value of `directory` with the path to a folder containing .xer files.
The test setup will recursively run through this folder and any children folders to find
all .xer files.

Caution: the more .xer files found, the longer the setup and test will take to run.
